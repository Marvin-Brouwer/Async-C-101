# Async C# 101

This is a repo with some quick examples to wrap your head around C# Async programming.  
It contains some helpful insights and links to get you started.  
This is not meant to teach you everything there is to know about async, it's just a visual aid to get you thinking async.  

[Browse ./books/](./books/) to start reading.  
The chapters are not necessarily in a particular order. However, 1 through 4 build up towards 4.

## Some useful resources

- [Async expert course](https://asyncexpert.com/)
  This is actually a great course that goes way deep into how `async` works and has some additional stuff around concurrency and threading.  
- [Dotnet async docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/)
  Very dry and practical, but good for reference
